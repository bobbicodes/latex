# shadow-reagent

Like the [official quickstart](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs), but without the extra steps.

Start the development process by running:

```bash
$ npx shadow-cljs watch app
...
[:app] Build completed. (134 files, 35 compiled, 0 warnings, 5.80s)
```

Or simply `jack-in` from your editor. Your app will be served at: at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Production build

```bash
npx shadow-cljs release app
```
